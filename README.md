## Description
        
Hey, have you ever seen the many movie review sites out there in the internet world? Haven't you always wanted a review site to talk about video games as well? Well this site is the site for you! This application is a video game review site. It can allow you to make an account and select games to review them and you can view other people's reviews of the games as well. You can also put the games in a wishlist to keep track of the games you want to play and talk about. This application was created using express.js, apollo server, graphql, mongoDb, mongoose, react, and vite.

## Installation
        
To install this application on your machine, you need clone the repository. To clone the repository, you go to the green button on the repository that says "< > Code". Then you can choose to copy either the https url or the ssh url if you have a ssh key. After you copy the link, then you go to your terminal on your computer and in the terminal, you change the current directory to the directory you want to place the cloned repository in and then you type "git clone" and paste the url. Finally, you hit enter and the repository will be on your machine and you can open the index.html in your browser by right clicking the html in the directory and choosing which browser to open it in. This application is also deployed on heroku and you can view the deployed application by clicking on this link: https://gameboxed.herokuapp.com/
        
## Usage
        
When you enter the site, you will see a button on the main page that will prompt you to sign up for an account. After you create an account with your email, password, and username, you can search up a game and click on the three dots on the top right. This will allow you to add it to a library, add it to played, and allow you to write a review. If you pick the review option, you can write a review by saying what date you played the game, what was your score out of a 100, and what were your comments on the game. Your comments can be anything as small as "This character was so cool!" to a big as a blog. By adding the games to the library, you are adding the games to the wishlist, allowing you to store the games and keep track of the ones you want to talk about later.
